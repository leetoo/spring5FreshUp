# Spring Framework 5: webApp bookstore 

This repository is for an example application built by me for fun 

The application is a simple Spring Boot 2/Spring Framework 5 web application.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
You can learn about my Spring Framework 5 Online course 
[here.](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/)

You can watch the progress of the app building by switching between branches starting from 
the branch step001-{short-description}. Try to make steps as small as possible to enable easy 
tracking pf the project progress.
